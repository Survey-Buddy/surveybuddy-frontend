### **CMP1003-1.1: Demonstration of DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) Principles**

<details>
<summary>View</summary>
</br>

This project demonstrates excellent adherence to DRY principles by avoiding unnecessary repetition and ensuring all functionality is centralised and reusable. The following approaches were implemented:

---

#### **1. Reusable Components**

- Modular and reusable UI components, such as buttons, forms, modals, and navigation menus, were created.
- **ShadCN** was used to build a consistent set of components, allowing for easy reuse across the application with configurable props.

#### **2. Centralised Utility Functions**

- A centralised Axios wrapper was implemented to manage all API calls, handling base URLs, headers, and error responses in one place.
- Shared validation schemas using **Zod** ensured consistent and reusable validation for forms across the application.

#### **3. Context and Global State Management**

- Global state was managed using **React Context**, reducing the need for repeated state logic and simplifying component communication. This was applied to manage features such as user authentication and theme settings.

#### **4. Tailwind CSS and Styling**

- Conditional and dynamic class management was achieved with **class-variance-authority** and **clsx**, ensuring reusable and consistent styling across components.
- A single Tailwind CSS configuration file was used to enforce consistent use of colours, spacing, and typography throughout the application.

#### **5. Backend Code Reusability**

- Middleware functions were created for common tasks such as authentication, role validation, and error handling, ensuring they could be reused across multiple routes.
- Modular MongoDB models, such as `Survey` and `User`, served as single sources of truth for database schema definitions.
- Shared logic for CRUD operations was abstracted into helper functions, reducing repeated code in controllers.

#### **6. Form Management**

- **React Hook Form** was used to handle form state and validation in a consistent and reusable manner, improving code maintainability and reducing duplication.

#### **7. Routing**

- Dynamic and nested routes in **React Router** were utilised to avoid duplicating route definitions and ensure consistent parent-child relationships in the app's structure.

---

By following these approaches, the project ensures that every piece of functionality is centralised, unambiguous, and has a single authoritative representation. This makes the codebase easier to maintain, scalable, and efficient.

### Crucial Decisions

**Schema Design Options**
Here are the options I considered for structuring the database:

**Option 1: Separate Schemas for Surveys, Questions, and Answers**

- Surveys have their own schema with metadata (e.g., title, description).
- Questions are stored in a separate schema linked to surveys via surveyId.
- Answers are stored in another schema, linked to both surveyId and questionId.
  Best for scalability and flexibility.
- Allows easy querying of specific questions or answers.

**Option 2: Combined Schema for Surveys and Questions, Separate Schema for Answers:**

- Surveys and their associated questions are embedded in one schema.
- Answers have a separate schema with references to surveyId and questionId.
- Reduces database reads but makes adding or editing questions more complex.

**Option 3: Single Schema for Surveys, Questions, and Answers:**

- Everything is stored in one schema with nested arrays.
- Simplifies initial setup but leads to large, complex documents.
- Poor scalability and performance for larger surveys.
  Decision to Use Option 1

I chose Option 1 because itâ€™s the most efficient and professional design for a real-world app. It separates concerns, making it easier to add features or scale the app later. It also demonstrates my ability to design a well-structured, normalised, and scalable database, which is an important skill in full-stack development. This approach is ideal for a school project where I want to showcase my expertise.

### Trello Board Tracking

#### 25th of November - Let The Build Begin!

- Created User Schema, Model, and Signup Controller route.
- Implemented password services (hashing and comparison) and user services (check for existing username/email).
- Developed JWT functions for token generation.
- Tested signup functionality using Insomnia.

![25th Nov Trelllo](/surveybuddy-client/src/assets/trello/trello_25:11.png)

#### 27th of November

- Created newQuestion endpoint to add new questions to the database.
- Implemented editQuestion endpoint to update specific fields of an existing question.
- Fixed issue where updates were not saving correctly by adjusting findByIdAndUpdate logic.
- Developed deleteQuestion endpoint to remove a question by ID.
- Enhanced error handling with detailed response messages and server-side logging.
- Tested all question-related endpoints for proper functionality.

![27th Nov Trelllo](/surveybuddy-client/src/assets/trello/trello_27:11.png)

#### 28th of November

- Implemented middleware to check if a question belongs to a specific survey (questionBelongsToSurvey).
- Updated survey and question schemas to better handle relationships between surveys and questions.
- Added logic to handle the question format validation within the editQuestion route.
- - Used findByIdAndUpdate to update questions with new data (question format, question text, and answer).
- Added validation checks to ensure data integrity when editing questions (checking for missing fields).
- Implemented checks to verify if a question exists before updating or deleting it.
- Debugged and tested the functionality of updating and deleting questions with the correct logic in place.
- Moved all MVP backend cards to the **DONE** column, will revisit in a few days to optimise code and introduce further middleware.

Due to underestimating how long building the backend MVP would take, the frontend cards due today were assigned a new due date of the 4th of Decemeber. After finishing the backend the next sprint will be to get these cards complete. Since I am behind schedule and working hard on getting the backend complete, the time extension is in no way an issue.
