### Crucial Decisions

<details>
<summary>View</summary>
</br>

**Schema Design Options**
Here are the options I considered for structuring the database:

**Option 1: Separate Schemas for Surveys, Questions, and Answers**

- Surveys have their own schema with metadata (e.g., title, description).
- Questions are stored in a separate schema linked to surveys via surveyId.
- Answers are stored in another schema, linked to both surveyId and questionId.
  Best for scalability and flexibility.
- Allows easy querying of specific questions or answers.

**Option 2: Combined Schema for Surveys and Questions, Separate Schema for Answers:**

- Surveys and their associated questions are embedded in one schema.
- Answers have a separate schema with references to surveyId and questionId.
- Reduces database reads but makes adding or editing questions more complex.

**Option 3: Single Schema for Surveys, Questions, and Answers:**

- Everything is stored in one schema with nested arrays.
- Simplifies initial setup but leads to large, complex documents.
- Poor scalability and performance for larger surveys.
  Decision to Use Option 1

I chose Option 1 because itâ€™s the most efficient and professional design for a real-world app. It separates concerns, making it easier to add features or scale the app later. It also demonstrates my ability to design a well-structured, normalised, and scalable database, which is an important skill in full-stack development. This approach is ideal for a school project where I want to showcase my expertise.

### **CMP1002-2.1: Demonstration of Code Flow Control**

<details>
<summary>View</summary>
</br>

The application effectively demonstrates code flow control by utilising conditional logic, loops, error handling, and asynchronous operations to manage how the application processes data and handles various scenarios. The following examples highlight how this is achieved:

---

#### **1. Conditional Logic**

- Conditional statements are used to handle various application states and behaviours. Examples include:
  - Checking if required fields are provided in the backend before processing API requests.
  - Verifying user authentication and authorisation using middleware before allowing access to protected routes.
  - Dynamically rendering UI elements based on user roles or data availability.

#### **2. Loops and Iteration**

- Iterative logic is applied in key areas of the application, such as:
  - Mapping over datasets to dynamically generate UI elements (e.g., survey lists, form inputs).
  - Iterating over responses from the database to format or filter data for specific frontend needs.

#### **3. Error Handling**

- Try-catch blocks are implemented to manage errors in both synchronous and asynchronous operations. For example:
  - API calls include error handling to provide meaningful feedback to the user in case of failures.
  - Validation errors in forms and database operations are caught and appropriately handled to prevent application crashes.

#### **4. Asynchronous Operations**

- Asynchronous code is used extensively to handle operations like:
  - Fetching data from external APIs or the database using `async/await`.
  - Updating the UI in real-time after receiving responses from the server.
  - Managing race conditions by awaiting specific operations before proceeding (e.g., user authentication before accessing dashboard data).

#### **5. Middleware for Controlled Flow**

- Middleware is used in the backend to control the flow of requests:
  - Authenticating users and rejecting unauthorised access.
  - Validating request data and blocking invalid inputs before they reach the main logic.

#### **6. Frontend State Control**

- React's state management is used to handle UI and data flow efficiently:
  - Loading states are implemented to control what is displayed while awaiting API responses.
  - Context is used to manage global states, such as user data and theme preferences, ensuring a consistent flow of information across components.

---

By implementing these strategies, the application ensures controlled, predictable, and efficient execution of code, meeting the requirements for demonstrating code flow control.

</details>

### **CMP1002-2.2: Application of Object-Oriented Principles/Patterns**

<details>
<summary>View</summary>
</br>

The application demonstrates superior use of object-oriented principles and patterns to enhance maintainability, scalability, and serviceability. The following object-oriented principles and patterns are applied throughout the app:

---

#### **1. Encapsulation**

- **Database Models**: Encapsulation is applied through modular MongoDB models (`Survey`, `User`, etc.), where each model defines its own properties and methods, ensuring a clear separation of concerns.
- **Controllers**: Backend logic is encapsulated into controller functions that handle specific responsibilities, such as creating, updating, or deleting resources. This structure prevents duplication and keeps related logic together.

#### **2. Inheritance**

- Shared middleware functions (e.g., for authentication and role validation) act as a base layer for route-specific middleware, following an inheritance-like structure. For example:
  - `isCreator` middleware extends basic authentication checks by adding role-specific logic.

#### **3. Polymorphism**

- Polymorphism is demonstrated in:
  - **Frontend Reusability**: Reusable React components (e.g., buttons, modals, forms) adapt to different contexts using props, allowing a single component to handle multiple use cases.
  - **Backend Methods**: Overriding default Mongoose schema methods (e.g., `toJSON`) for formatting database output to suit the application's requirements.

#### **4. Abstraction**

- **Utilities and Services**: Common logic, such as validation, API requests, and error handling, is abstracted into utility functions and shared services. This abstraction hides implementation details while exposing clear, reusable interfaces.
- **Routes**: Backend routing uses layered abstraction:
  - Routes define the entry points.
  - Middleware handles common processing (e.g., validation, authentication).
  - Controllers handle the core business logic.

#### **5. Modular Design**

- The project is structured into self-contained modules:
  - Models, controllers, and routes are separated to ensure a clear and maintainable architecture.
  - Shared components, utilities, and constants are stored in dedicated folders to promote reuse and consistency.

#### **6. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**

- Each class, function, and module is designed to perform a single responsibility:
  - Controllers focus solely on business logic.
  - Middleware handles authentication, validation, and error checking.
  - React components handle specific UI elements without coupling logic.

#### **7. Dependency Injection**

- The app follows dependency injection principles:
  - Middleware injects required data (e.g., `req.user`) into controllers.
  - Components receive data and actions as props, promoting testability and flexibility.

#### **8. Positive Impact on Maintainability and Serviceability**

- The use of these object-oriented principles has the following benefits:
  - **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns ensures that changes can be made in one area without affecting others.
  - **Scalability**: Modular design and reusable patterns make it easy to add new features or expand existing functionality.
  - **Serviceability**: Abstraction and encapsulation reduce code complexity, making debugging and updates straightforward.

## Trello Board Tracking

<details>
<summary>View</summary>
</br>

#### 25th of November - Let The Build Begin!

- Set up the backend skeleton and connected to MongoDB Atlas.
- Created User Schema, Model, and Signup Controller route.
- Implemented password services (hashing and comparison) and user services (check for existing username/email).
- Developed JWT functions for token generation.
- Tested signup functionality using Insomnia.

![25th Nov Trelllo](/surveybuddy-client/src/assets/trello/trello_25:11.png)

#### 27th of November

- Built middleware to validate question and answer inputs.
- Created newQuestion endpoint to add new questions to the database.
- Implemented editQuestion endpoint to update specific fields of an existing question.
- Fixed issue where updates were not saving correctly by adjusting findByIdAndUpdate logic.
- Developed deleteQuestion endpoint to remove a question by ID.
- Enhanced error handling with detailed response messages and server-side logging.
- Tested all question-related endpoints for proper functionality.

![27th Nov Trelllo](/surveybuddy-client/src/assets/trello/trello_27:11.png)

#### 28th of November

- Implemented middleware to check if a question belongs to a specific survey (questionBelongsToSurvey).
- Updated survey and question schemas to better handle relationships between surveys and questions.
- Added logic to handle the question format validation within the editQuestion route.
- - Used findByIdAndUpdate to update questions with new data (question format, question text, and answer).
- Added validation checks to ensure data integrity when editing questions (checking for missing fields).
- Implemented checks to verify if a question exists before updating or deleting it.
- Debugged and tested the functionality of updating and deleting questions with the correct logic in place.
- Moved all MVP backend cards to the **DONE** column, will revisit in a few days to optimise code and introduce further middleware.

Due to underestimating how long building the backend MVP would take, the frontend cards due today were assigned a new due date of the 4th of Decemeber. After finishing the backend the next sprint will be to get these cards complete. Since I am behind schedule and working hard on getting the backend complete, the time extension is in no way an issue.
