### **CMP1003-1.1: Demonstration of DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) Principles**

<details>
<summary>View</summary>
</br>

This project demonstrates excellent adherence to DRY principles by avoiding unnecessary repetition and ensuring all functionality is centralised and reusable. The following approaches were implemented:

---

#### **1. Reusable Components**

- Modular and reusable UI components, such as buttons, forms, cards, badges, and navigation menus, were created.
- **ShadCN** components were used to build a consistent set of components, allowing for easy reuse across the application with configurable props.

#### **2. Centralised Utility Functions**

- I applied DRY principles by creating a shared functions file for API requests, ensuring consistent and reusable logic across the application. This centralisation reduced redundancy, improved maintainability, and promoted a single source of truth for common operations like data fetching and token handling.

#### **3. Context and Global State Management**

- Global state was managed using **React Context**, reducing the need for repeated state logic and simplifying component communication. This was applied to manage features such as user authentication and user data.

#### **4. Backend Code Reusability**

- Middleware functions were created for common tasks such as authentication, creator validation, and question formatting, ensuring they could be reused across multiple routes.
- Modular MongoDB models, such as `Survey` and `User`, served as single sources of truth for database schema definitions.

#### **5. Form Management**

- **React Hook Form** was used to handle form state and validation in a consistent and reusable manner, improving code maintainability and reducing duplication.
- Forms components were used for multiple purposes for creating a new survey and auto populated for editing survey data.

---

By following these approaches, the project ensures that every piece of functionality is centralised, unambiguous, and has a single authoritative representation. This makes the codebase easier to maintain, scalable, and efficient.

### **CMP1002-2.1: Demonstration of Code Flow Control**

<details>
<summary>View</summary>
</br>

The application effectively demonstrates code flow control by utilising conditional logic, loops, error handling, and asynchronous operations to manage how the application processes data and handles various scenarios. The following examples highlight how this is achieved:

---

#### **1. Conditional Logic**

- Conditional statements are used to handle various application states and behaviours. Examples include:
  - Checking if required fields are provided before conditionally rendering forms.
  - Verifying user authentication and authorisation using middleware before allowing access to protected routes.
  - Dynamically rendering UI elements based on if a user is signed in or data availability.

#### **2. Loops and Iteration**

- Iterative logic is applied in key areas of the application, such as:
  - Mapping over datasets to dynamically generate UI elements (e.g., survey lists).
  - Iterating over responses from the database to format or filter data for specific question result charts and graphs.

#### **3. Error Handling**

- Try-catch blocks are implemented to manage errors in both synchronous and asynchronous operations. For example:
  - API calls include error handling to provide meaningful feedback to the user in case of failures.
  - Validation errors in forms and database operations are caught and appropriately handled to prevent application crashes.

#### **4. Asynchronous Operations**

- Asynchronous code is used extensively to handle operations like:
  - Fetching data from external APIs or the database using `async/await`.
  - Updating the UI in real-time after receiving responses from the server.
  - Managing race conditions by awaiting specific operations before proceeding (e.g., user authentication before accessing homepage data).

#### **5. Middleware for Controlled Flow**

- Middleware is used in the backend to control the flow of requests:
  - Authenticating users and rejecting unauthorised access.
  - Validating request data and blocking invalid inputs before they reach the main logic.
  - Formatting data conditionally such as question format.

#### **6. Frontend State Control**

- React's state management is used to handle UI and data flow efficiently:
  - Loading states are implemented to control what is displayed while awaiting API responses (loading for example).
  - Tab state it updated and data is passed to different schemas conditionally dependent on value of said state.
  - Context is used to manage global states, such as user data, ensuring a consistent flow of information across components.

---

By implementing these strategies, the application ensures controlled, predictable, and efficient execution of code, meeting the requirements for demonstrating code flow control.

</details>

### **CMP1002-2.2: Application of Object-Oriented Principles/Patterns**

<details>
<summary>View</summary>
</br>

The application demonstrates superior use of object-oriented principles and patterns to enhance maintainability, scalability, and serviceability. The following object-oriented principles and patterns are applied throughout the app:

---

#### **1. Encapsulation**

- **Database Models**: Encapsulation is applied through modular MongoDB models (`Survey`, `User`, etc.), where each model defines its own properties and methods, ensuring a clear separation of concerns.
- **Controllers**: Backend logic is encapsulated into controller functions that handle specific responsibilities, such as creating, updating, or deleting resources. This structure prevents duplication and keeps related logic together.

#### **2. Inheritance**

- Shared middleware functions (e.g., for authentication and validation) act as a base layer for route-specific middleware, following an inheritance-like structure. For example:
  - `isCreator` middleware extends basic authentication checks by adding role-specific logic.

#### **3. Polymorphism**

- Polymorphism is demonstrated in:
  - **Frontend Reusability**: Reusable React components (e.g., buttons, forms) adapt to different contexts using props or conditional statements, allowing a single component to handle multiple use cases.

#### **4. Abstraction**

- **Utilities and Services**: Common logic, such as validation, API requests, and types, are abstracted into utility functions and shared services. This abstraction hides implementation details while exposing clear, reusable interfaces.
- **Routes**: Backend routing uses layered abstraction:
  - Routes define the entry points.
  - Middleware handles common processing (e.g., validation, formatting, authentication).
  - Controllers handle the core business logic.

#### **5. Modular Design**

- The project is structured into self-contained modules:
  - Models, controllers, and routes are separated to ensure a clear and maintainable architecture.
  - Shared components, utilities, and constants are stored in dedicated folders to promote reuse and consistency.

#### **6. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**

- Each class, function, and module is designed to perform a single responsibility:
  - Controllers focus solely on business logic.
  - Middleware handles authentication, validation, formatting, and error checking.
  - React components handle specific UI elements without coupling too much logic where possible.

#### **7. Dependency Injection**

- The app follows dependency injection principles:
  - Middleware injects required data (e.g., `request.user`) into controllers.
  - Components receive data and actions as props or via params, promoting testability and flexibility.

#### **8. Positive Impact on Maintainability and Serviceability**

- The use of these object-oriented principles has the following benefits:
  - **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns ensures that changes can be made in one area without affecting others.
  - **Scalability**: Modular design and reusable patterns make it easy to add new features or expand existing functionality.
  - **Serviceability**: Abstraction and encapsulation reduce code complexity, making debugging and updates straightforward.

---

By incorporating these object-oriented principles and patterns throughout the application, the project ensures high code quality, maintainability, and scalability while adhering to professional development standards.

Each video provides a step-by-step demonstration of the corresponding feature to ensure clarity and ease of understanding for users and stakeholders.

### Client Testing

A survey about dogs was tested with fellow students, who acted as clients since they are part of the app's target market. This testing demonstrated the app's user-friendliness and smooth survey flow. Multiple answers were recorded for each question, and all participants who began the survey completed all the questions. Additionally, students were provided with login access to view the survey data and create their own surveys. As a result, three new surveys were created by the students, highlighting the simplicity of survey and question creation for the target audience.

### Formal Testing Framework Utilisation

<details>
<summary>View</summary>
</br>

Throughout the project, I implemented a formal testing framework to ensure the application's reliability and robustness. Hereâ€™s how testing was structured:

#### Comprehensive Testing Suite:

- **Backend Testing**:
  - Developed a suite of **unit tests** for key backend functions, including database operations and API route handlers.
  - Utilised **integration tests** to simulate real-world workflows, such as survey creation, question management, and answer submission.
  - Achieved detailed test coverage for **error handling**, ensuring edge cases were accounted for and properly managed.
    ![Backend Testing](surveybuddy-client/src/assets/images/backendTesting.png)
- **Frontend Testing**:
  - Wrote unit tests for React components, focusing on UI behavior and state management.
  - Conducted integration tests to validate workflows like user authentication and survey interactions.
    ![Frontend Testing](surveybuddy-client/src/assets/images/FrontEndTesting.png)

#### Coverage Goals:

- **Code Coverage**:
  - Maintained a high standard for coverage, with detailed reports generated to highlight areas for improvement.
  - Though 90% coverage wasnâ€™t reached due to time constraints, significant progress was made toward this benchmark and future testing will be implemented after submission.

#### Examples of Tested Scenarios:

1. **User Authentication**:
   - Verified that users could sign up, log in, and access protected routes.
   - Tested JWT token handling in both backend and frontend.
2. **Survey Workflow**:
   - Ensured end-to-end functionality for creating surveys, adding questions, and submitting answers.
   - Validated cascading relationships between surveys, questions, and answers.
3. **Frontend UI**:
   - Confirmed proper rendering of dynamic components such as Survey Cards and responsive navigation.
   - Tested validation and error states for forms (though functions like isValid and other rendering constraints made this difficult).

#### Reflection and Next Steps:

While a robust testing framework was established, additional time would have allowed further refinement. Future iterations will focus on:

- Expanding the test suite to cover all edge cases.
- Achieving at least 90% code coverage as a project standard.
- Incorporating advanced end-to-end tests to simulate user flows more comprehensively.

By utilising formal testing practices, the project demonstrated strong foundations in reliability and user experience assurance.

I have recognised front end testing as an area where I need improvement, and I am committed to making it my top learning priority in the coming months to ensure future projects are more robust and thoroughly validated. Given this was my first experience with testing, I am satisfied with my effort, and should I have opted for an app with less features, or worked with another team member, this would have given me adequate time to meet the 90% required threshold.

### **CMP1002-7.4: Employ and utilise task delegation methodology**

<details>
<summary>View</summary>
</br>

### Task Delegation and Kanban Workflow

To effectively manage tasks, I utilised a Kanban board with tickets assigned to team members, labeled with difficulty levels and linked to corresponding Git commits. Beyond marking difficulty levels on the cards, I added labels for quick identification of specific areas that required work. Midway through the project, I introduced a high-level labeling system for better oversightâ€”a practice I plan to implement from the start in future projects. Git commits were consistently tied to Kanban tickets and moved to the "done" column upon task completion, ensuring clear tracking of progress.

#### Strengths and Approach

My primary strength lies in backend development, so I began by creating the survey and question routes, models, and controllers. This approach allowed for seamless testing of backend routes from the frontend. Afterward, I transitioned to frontend development and allocated time to research, as working with new styling libraries required additional learning.

#### Challenges and Adaptations

This project was my first extensive experience in managing and estimating timelines for complex tasks. As such, multiple date adjustments were made to Kanban cards throughout the project. Additionally, learning TypeScript alongside completing project tasks was more challenging than anticipated. Despite the difficulties, I am pleased with the decision to use TypeScript, as it has significantly enhanced my technical skills and project outcomes.

In conclusion, while the project presented challenges, the strategic use of Kanban for task delegation, combined with adaptive learning, contributed to the success of the project.

### **Crucial Decisions**

<details>
<summary>View</summary>
</br>

**Schema Design Options**
Here are the options I considered for structuring the database:

**Option 1: Separate Schemas for Surveys, Questions, and Answers**

- Surveys have their own schema with metadata (e.g., title, description).
- Questions are stored in a separate schema linked to surveys via surveyId.
- Answers are stored in another schema, linked to both surveyId and questionId.
  Best for scalability and flexibility.
- Allows easy querying of specific questions or answers.

**Option 2: Combined Schema for Surveys and Questions, Separate Schema for Answers:**

- Surveys and their associated questions are embedded in one schema.
- Answers have a separate schema with references to surveyId and questionId.
- Reduces database reads but makes adding or editing questions more complex.

**Option 3: Single Schema for Surveys, Questions, and Answers:**

- Everything is stored in one schema with nested arrays.
- Simplifies initial setup but leads to large, complex documents.
- Poor scalability and performance for larger surveys.
  Decision to Use Option 1

I chose Option 1 because itâ€™s the most efficient and professional design for a real-world app. It separates concerns, making it easier to add features or scale the app later. It also demonstrates my ability to design a well-structured, normalised, and scalable database, which is an important skill in full-stack development. This approach is ideal for a school project where I want to showcase my expertise.
